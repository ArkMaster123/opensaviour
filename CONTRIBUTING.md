# Contributing to OpenSaviour

We want to make it easy for you to contribute to OpenCode. Here are the most common type of changes that get merged:

- Bug fixes
- Additional LSPs / Formatters
- Improvements to LLM performance
- Support for new providers
- Fixes for environment-specific quirks
- Missing standard behavior
- Documentation improvements

However, any UI or core product feature must go through a design review with the core team before implementation.

If you are unsure if a PR would be accepted, feel free to ask a maintainer
